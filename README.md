## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sambathkumar0212/pawnshop.git
   cd pawnshop
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv pawnshop_env
   source pawnshop_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: pawnshop_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies :
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your database and other settings
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Quick Development Setup

1. Make the setup script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x dev_setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the development setup script:
   ```bash
   ./dev_setup.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Create and activate virtual environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Set up development environment
   - Run migrations
   - Create default superuser (if needed)
   - Start the development server

   Default superuser credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
   - Email: admin@example.com

3. Access the application:
   - Admin interface: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

## Getting Started

After installation, follow these steps to set up your pawnshop:

1. **Create Roles**: Define user roles (Admin, Manager, Cashier, etc.)
2. **Create Branches**: Set up your pawnshop locations
3. **Create Users**: Add staff members and assign them to branches
4. **Configure Settings**: Set loan durations, interest rates, biometric settings, etc.
5. **Create Categories**: Set up inventory categories
6. **Start using the system**: Begin recording loans, sales, and inventory

## Biometric Setup

To use facial recognition features:

1. Make sure you have dlib and face_recognition packages properly installed
2. Create required directories:
   ```
   mkdir -p media/faces
   ```

3. Enable biometric settings for your branch in the admin interface

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `DEBUG=False` in the environment
2. Configure a proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Set up static files serving with Whitenoise or a web server
4. Use Gunicorn or uWSGI as the application server
5. Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache

Example Gunicorn command:
```
gunicorn pawnshop_management.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Deployment on Render

1. **Push to GitHub  **

2. **Create a Render Web Service**  
   - Log in to [Render](https://render.com).
   - Select "New" and then "Web Service".
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository containing this project.

3. **Configure Render Settings**  
   - **Build Command:**  
     ```
