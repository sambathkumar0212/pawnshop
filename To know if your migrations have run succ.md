To know if your migrations have run successfully in your Django pawnshop management application, there are several methods you can use. Let me provide you with a comprehensive solution for monitoring your migrations, especially in your production environment on Render.

First, let's create a simple migration status endpoint that you can check:
urls.py+42-0
Now, let's also add a simple script that you can use to check migration status from your start.sh script or other automated processes. This will make it easy to verify that migrations have run successfully:

check_migrations.py+116-1
Finally, let's update your start.sh script to check migration status after running migrations and to create a migration status file that you can easily access:

start.sh+19-0
I've set up multiple ways for you to know when migrations have run successfully in your Django pawnshop management application. Here's how you can check if your migrations have run:

1. Using the Migration Status Endpoint
I added a migration status endpoint that you can access from your browser or API client:

This endpoint will return JSON with:

The overall status of migrations (ok or incomplete)
A list of all applied migrations grouped by app
Information about the most recently applied migration
The total count of applied migrations
This endpoint is secured so only superusers can access it when DEBUG is False.

2. Checking Status Files in Static Directory
Your application now creates status files during startup that you can check:

/static/status/migrations.json - Detailed JSON report of migration status
/static/status/migration_status.txt - Simple text file with SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE
You can access these at:

3. Checking the Application Logs
The updated start.sh script now logs the migration status, so you can check the application logs in the Render dashboard for messages like:

"✅ Migrations completed successfully!"
"✅ All migrations are properly applied"
If there are issues, you'll see:

"⚠️ Migrations failed! Check /tmp/migration_*.log for details"
"⚠️ Migration status check indicates issues"
4. Running the Check Script Manually
You can also manually run the migration check script via a support shell in Render (if available):

This will print a detailed JSON report of your migration status and exit with code 0 if all migrations are applied or code 1 if there are issues.

What to Look For
When checking if migrations have run successfully, look for these indicators:

The migration status endpoint returns "status": "ok"
The status files contain "SUCCESS"
All your critical apps (accounts, branches, inventory, transactions) appear in the list of applied migrations
The "unapplied_migrations" list in the JSON report is empty
These tools make it easy to monitor your migrations, especially since they run in the background during the application startup process.
